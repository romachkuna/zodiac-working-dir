Application is now on Google Play Store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.romanitodua.cosmicguide

Horoscope Application implemented with Riverpod2.0 for state management (with recommended syntax from Riverpod docs). For caching the primitive values(is darkmode on? has the user chosen their zodiac sign) application uses SharedPreferences package from pub.dev. the backend is a firebase database.

Application Demo (Note that the quality in the video is bad, application is smooth on emulators and real devices)
also the firebase database has dummy values , that is what it is fetching(this process is so fast that the loading isnt even visible on the application but they are handled as well as errors)
